# PyCaret - A AutoML Library

## Overview

PyCaret is an automated Machine Learning Library used for doing automated tasks such as doing training on big datasets and carrying out advanced Machhine Learning operations without writing huge lines of code. Here we took different datasets which you will get inbuilt inside this library itself and carried out basic machine learning tasks by using some classification and regression algorithms.

## Installation

Just like you install any other Machine Learning library, you can easily install Pycaret hassle-free without any issues. In my case I created a virtual environment for this task and I also recommend you all to create virtual environment so that you will not face any kind of conflicts related to dependencies. Run the following code to get Pycaret sucessfully installed on your system.

- Creating Virtual Environment

  ```conda create --name yourenvname python=3.7```

- Activating Virtual Environment

  ```conda activate yourenvname```
  
- Installing Pycaret library

  ``` pip install pycaret```
  
  Once you're done with installation you are all set to do all types of machine learning operations using any of the dataset of your choice and implement machine learning models
